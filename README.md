## RFC: Enhancing Trading Capabilities in a Decentralized Trading Application

### Summary
This RFC proposes a comprehensive enhancement of the decentralized trading application by implementing robust Web3 wallet integrations, enhancing order management, and improving the user interface for trading futures, perpetuals and spot. The goal is to improve user experience, increase platform adoption, and streamline trading operations.

### Background
The decentralized trading application requires significant enhancements to meet user demands and stay competitive in the fast-evolving blockchain and DeFi space. The protocol aims to provide a decentralized infrastructure for scalable, high-performance trading. The current system lacks seamless Web3 wallet integrations, efficient order management, and an intuitive user interface for trading various financial instruments. Addressing these gaps is crucial for improving user experience, increasing adoption, and maintaining a competitive edge in the market.

### Problem Statement
The existing application faces the following challenges:
1. **Lack of seamless Web3 wallet integrations**: Users face difficulties in connecting and managing their Web3 wallets, leading to poor user experience.
2. **Inefficient order management**: Current order and position management functionalities are limited, affecting trading efficiency.
3. **Suboptimal user interface**: The UI for trading futures and perpetuals needs improvements to enhance usability and accessibility.

### Goals
1. **Improve Web3 wallet integration**: Provide seamless and secure integration with popular Web3 wallets.
2. **Enhance order management**: Implement comprehensive order and position management features.
3. **Upgrade user interface**: Redesign the UI to improve user experience and accessibility for trading futures and perpetuals.

### Scope
- **In Scope**:
  - Integration with major Web3 wallets (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.)
  - Development of order management features including order books, spot swap UI, and position tracking
  - UI redesign for trading futures and perpetuals
- **Out of Scope**:
  - Backend infrastructure changes
  - Non-trading related UI components
  - Marketing and user acquisition strategies

### Proposed Solution

3. **Operational Efficiency**: Advanced order management features will streamline trading operations and improve efficiency.
4. **Competitive Advantage**: Staying ahead in the DeFi space with state-of-the-art features and user experience.

### Tradeoffs
1. **Development Time**: The proposed enhancements will require significant development time and resources.
2. **Complexity**: Integrating multiple Web3 wallets and redesigning the UI adds complexity to the project.
3. **Risk of Bugs**: Extensive changes increase the risk of introducing bugs, necessitating thorough testing and quality assurance.

### Risks and Mitigations
- **Security Risks**: Implement robust security protocols and conduct regular audits to mitigate potential security threats.
- **Integration Challenges**: Conduct thorough testing of wallet integrations to ensure compatibility and stability.
- **User Adoption**: Provide clear documentation and user guides to facilitate smooth adoption of new features.

### Alternatives Considered
- **Alternative Wallet Integrations**: Evaluated other wallets but chose MetaMask and WalletConnect due to their popularity and user base.
- **Backend Enhancements**: Considered but deferred to a later stage to focus on immediate user-facing improvements.

### Success Metrics
- **User Adoption**: Increase in the number of active users and wallet connections.
- **Trading Volume**: Growth in trading volume and transaction throughput.
- **User Satisfaction**: Positive user feedback and reduction in support tickets related to trading functionalities.

### Conclusion
Enhancing the decentralized trading application with improved Web3 wallet integrations, advanced order management features, and a redesigned user interface will significantly boost user experience and platform adoption. This RFC outlines a detailed plan to achieve these goals, ensuring the Vega Protocol remains competitive and user-friendly.
